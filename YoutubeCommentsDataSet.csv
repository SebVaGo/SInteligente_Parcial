lets not forget that apple pay in 2014 required a brand new iphone in order to use it a significant portion of apples user base wasnt able to use it even if they wanted to as each successive iphone incorporated the technology and older iphones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased,neutral;;
here in nz 50 of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don’t like the high fees that come with these,negative;;
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,positive;;
whenever i go to a place that doesn’t take apple pay doesn’t happen too often it’s such a drag between ‘contactless covid’ habits and my getting the apple card i’ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it it feels like a shock it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i’ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,negative;;
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,positive;;
we’ve been hounding my bank to adopt apple pay i understand why they don’t want to do it with the extra fees but its just so easy and quick at the checkout,neutral;;
we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 and it’s widely accepted,positive;;
for now i need both apple pay and the physical credit card,neutral;;
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,positive;;
in cambodia we have a universal qr code system we scan and send money back and forth all banks take no profit from merchant they receive 100 of the payment a lot of stores and supermarkets start abandon pos machine all together,neutral;;

the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,positive;;
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,positive;;
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,positive;;
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,negative;;
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,positive;;
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,positive;;
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,positive;;
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,positive;;
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,positive;;
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,positive;;

dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,positive;;
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,positive;;
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,positive;;
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,positive;;

guys a quick note that you do not need all the highend tech in order to do well at college if you can and you should save as much money as you can while at college pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 46 years such as laptop dont overspend on phone headphones lamps tablets etc,neutral;;
this is hilarious i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for best buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for back to school one of the kids next to me said maybe you should have someone like mkbhd talk about your products well here we are,neutral;;
everyone has been saying it but i’ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base ipad from late 2020 both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i’m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,positive;;
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps 20 and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same 2 sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,positive;;
best buy we want to sponsor a back to school type video but you can only push the high end stuff marques say less,neutral;;
most of the items you recommend are pretty pricey for a student im not a student myself anymore but if i were one more budget alternatives would make this video a lot better,neutral;;
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,positive;;
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave2ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,positive;;
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has 8gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x455l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y69redmi 10samsung a22 4g mouse logitech g102 keyboard tecware tkl ver,positive;;
i have used galaxy tab s7 during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s7 and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s7 i choose tab s7 over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,positive;;
when he says hes a 400 year old beer wizard i believe him,neutral;;
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,positive;;
regarding cans vs bottles at least in germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly since they get used again and again you bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop they then get sent to a cleaning plant where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water afterwards they get reused for beer the size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard so different brewers use the same bottles its far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans,neutral;;

one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,positive;;
shout to you john oliver for giving me a brief trip down memory lane ive been in the telecommunications industry for almost 25 years and my first job was atmci great company that got swallowed up in a horrible merger with worldcom bing it and see how that disaster played out,neutral;;
back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people  i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know ,negative;;

i would love to see these bills live i live in a country where we had one company try and rule the internet charging outrageous prices for it they had specifically bought the copper network to do it the government of nz denied that as a defense as they were monopolising it and forced them to open up suddenly it turned out it didnt cost 300 to connect to unlimited internet you could get that for 80,neutral;;
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,negative;;
points that were missed apple arguably has a specific monopoly in the us with smartphones because of imessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps this weirdly only applies in the states the rest of the world favours things like whatsapp and facebook messenger both owned by meta which is its own issue thats probably the main defence apple will bring up theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about microsoft windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove this kind of got glossed over but although google play takes the same cut for purchases as apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there google play is still the most preferred store on android phones so google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software,neutral;;

if machines produce everything we need the outcome will depend on how things are distributed everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machineproduced wealth is shared or most people can end up miserably poor if the machineowners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution so far the trend seems to be toward the second option with technology driving everincreasing inequality stephen hawking,neutral;;
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,negative;;

i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,negative;;

i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,positive;;

in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,negative;;

i have a high paying tech job that i’m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after 5 years i know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly i’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year i’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don’t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too ,positive;;
i’m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i’ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,positive;;
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,positive;;
compare that to physicians only 42 said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,positive;;
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at 50k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,negative;;

that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,negative;;
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,positive;;
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,negative;;

i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,negative;;
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,positive;;
a favourite trick is to upscale a low resolution image before applying the compression that way they get to claim a higher resolution on the box ive analysed a few of these now,neutral;;
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,positive;;
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,positive;;
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,positive;;
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo d80 australian nz market volway,positive;;
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f70 if the budget isnt too tight,positive;;
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,negative;;
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,negative;;

in spite of the huge upgrades especially for the pro models it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iphone 14 lineup given that the iphone 13 lineup is as popular as ever,positive;;
honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol,positive;;
i’ve been holding out cause i just felt it wasn’t worth upgrading but with everything coming to the 14 pro and the diminishing battery on my current iphone x it might be time to retire my phone after 5 years,neutral;;
definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,positive;;
in my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made seems i’m in a minority but it’s brilliant,positive;;
eh i’m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,positive;;
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone 15 pro which will be scheduled to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me,positive;;
im getting the pro been using the 12 pro max since it came out and i think its too big for one hand use,neutral;;
i might upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,positive;;

this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin ,positive;;

interesting note real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship it also grows only in a specific riverbank environment which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply when young real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy the wasabi that comes with your sushi dinner in america it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring this greendyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food,neutral;;
that “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now,positive;;
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i’m a lawyer and after this one video i’m prepared to quit and pursue taste ,positive;;
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box ,positive;;
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,negative;;

the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,positive;;
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,positive;;

ai is the most important one a lot of people think ai is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point the main implications of ai is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen is that ai is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science it is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change everything about life far more than the industrial era did for example 300 years from now we can have an ai program that has been improving itself for 300 years we lose about 14 million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries so while i understand people being skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close ai is going to be able to do many many things better than humans at some point these quantum computers are going to make ai they could program an ai to make a better ai of itself an improved version then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it etc etc there is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens,neutral;;
the claim about the quantum computer came and went im not sure who is on top id like to see more of the chinese tech we seem to have very little insight into what they are doing,neutral;;

askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,negative;;

another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact,negative;;
askgcntech as a heavier rider i feel i’m always in the max range of gears either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when i see any sustained gradients i currently run a compact chain set with a 1230 cassette on the rear would i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear,negative;;
i bought an old tractor to help clear the land i was building on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction due to the added weight maybe sealant would be a better idea expensive though love the show guys,positive;;

1035 this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,negative;;

the biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees causing this to happen,negative;;

he needs to find a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates and quit trying to game a broken student loan system this will just keep happening and its not going to stop idealistic young people from taking out massive debt on a useless degree the schools need to be regulated if they take govt funds then they should be subject to immediate regulation,negative;;

to be clear its not alleged war crimes they have tried and convicted people for them already so yes war crimes are being committed in ukraine just because you dont like saying it doesnt change that its actually happening to the people it affects,negative;;
i whole heartedly agree with the guy from nato who was saying that europe and the us will pay a high price this winter for supporting ukraine this winter but not supporting them will cost us even more the biggest threat to ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest and abandon them ukraine needs to get all their territory back or russia is just going to eat them in bites and then they will move to the next nation that they want to add back to the soviet union,negative;;
happy independence day to ukraine and glory  the reason why i support ukraine because i’m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won’t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don’t treat ukrainians as people,negative;;
he thought it would take him 3 days to take over all of ukraine its been 6 months and he barely took a small part of the east and south and even there ukraine from time to time take some sections back ukraine deserves most of the credit they have proven themselves not just brave and tenacious but also skilled capable the west deserves the rest of the credit putin actually managed to unite us,neutral;;

something important to know for all who are interested in history andor support ukraine rus’ ought not to be confused with “russia” which derives its name from the rus’ but historically is a completely different state which almost all its existence was at war with the rus’ just like the holy roman empire was actually germany russia is actually muscovy despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise its name “russia received only in 1721 when peter i passed a decree to change tsardom of muscovy’s name into the “russian” empire “russia” originates from rosia name used by the greek orthodox clergy in regards to kyivan rus under the reign of cathrine ii muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as muscovites and were forced to call themselves “russian” lands that “russia” claims were part of the original rus’ but actually werent are novgorod suzdal and ryazan since in historical texts of xixii centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from rus’ they can be considered parts of extended rus’ although their culture was distinct from main rus’ in 1493 moscow prince ivan iii appointed himself to be the great ruler of all rus’ no other kings acknowledged that from that point on muscovy started to make false claims on rus’ ownership “russia” is an offshoot of ukraine and not the other way round despite what soviet and “russian” historians have been trying to say for years kiev was a developed cultured capital when moscow was just another swamp village germany used to call itself the holy roman empire that didn’t mean they became the romans and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of italy and its history but yet that’s exactly what “russia” did in regards to rus’ukraine which is a horrible injustice,neutral;;
